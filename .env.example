# =======================================================
# HAWKI 2: Configuration environment varibales (template)
# =======================================================
#
# HAWKI 2 is built with the Lavarel framework for PHP. This allows to configure the
# application by editing the *.php files in the config directory. However, by default
# these files are writtin in such a way that most settings can also be changed with
# environment variables. This is handy because changing the config files would mean
# to change the HAWKI 2 source code, since these files are managed in the HAWKI git
# repository and also contained in the installation packages. Environment variables,
# however, are set in the OS (or your hosting environment).
#
# Additionaly, Lavarel reads the contents of a .env file in the project root directory
# to override the environment variables. This file is not contained in the HAWKI
# installation as it is meant for developers and administrators to set their local
# configuration values.
#
# This file is a template for the .env file. It documents all relevant settings,
# their allowed values and their defaults. Simply copy this file (don't just rename
# it) to a new file called .env and change the values as needed. The pre-set values
# will provide a sensible configuration for a "localhost deployment" for developers.
# Commented out settings are not strictly needed and usually contain the default
# values found in the config/*.php files.

# ===========================

# ===============
# Database server
# ===============
#
# HAWKI uses a database to save chats and other data. For this a relation SQL database
# like MariaDB (MySQL) or Postgres should be used in production. For local development
# SQlite provides a zero-config default solution (but note that SQlite is single-user
# only and stores all data in a single file).
#
# IMPORTANT: When using a database other than SQlite set DB_DATABASE to a sensible value.
# Because the default value in config/database.php is "lavarel" which is less clear and
# could at least in theory already be in use by other applications.
#
#  - DB_CONNECTION: Database server type: "mysql", "sqlite", "mariadb", "pgsql", "sqlsrv" (see config/database.php)
#  - DB_URL:        Database connection URL (instead of host and port)
#  - DB_HOST:       Database server host name
#  - DB_PORT:       Database server port number
#  - DB_SOCKET:     Unix domain socket instead of URL, host and port (MySQL and MariaDB only)
#  - DB_DATABASE:   Database name (please change!)
#  - DB_USERNAME:   Username to access the database server
#  - DB_PASSWORD:   Password to access the database server
#  - DB_CHARSET:    Character encoding of the database
#  - DB_COLLATION:  Database collation (MySQL and MariaDB only)

# ==================
# Filesystem Storage
# ==================
#
# Uploaded media files are typically stored on disk and served from an asset web server.
# However, to simplify the setup the uploaded files will be served by PHP by default,
# though thos is not so good for performance. Alternateively Amazon S3 could be used.
#
# NOTE: If you want to serve media files with your web server, choose "public" for
# FILESYSTEM_DISK. In this case make the server serve the files from the "app/public"
# directory. The HTTP address must be your APP_URL followed by "/storage".
#
#  - FILESYSTEM_DISK:             Storage type: "local", "public", "s3" (see config/filesystem.php)

#
# These are essential Laravel default variables for session management and they must be
# present and active to ensure proper session handling within the application.
#
# SESSION_DRIVER: Specifies the session "driver" or handler used to store session data.
# Common choices include "file", "cookie", "database", etc. Typically, "database" is used
# if sessions are stored in the database.
#
# SESSION_LIFETIME: The session lifetime in minutes. It determines how long a session
# remains active before it expires.
#
# SESSION_ENCRYPT: Indicates whether session data should be encrypted. Accepts "true" or "false".

# =================================
# SSL Certificate Configuration
# =================================
#
# These environment variables are used to specify the SSL certificate and the corresponding
# private key that are essential for establishing secure TLS/SSL connections in certain
# broadcasting setups. This is particularly crucial when using Reverb or similar services
# with encrypted connections, ensuring data is securely transmitted over HTTPS.
#
# SSL_CERTIFICATE: Specifies the path to your SSL certificate file. This certificate is used
# to authenticate and establish a secure connection between the server and the client.
#
# SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY: Specifies the path to the private key file corresponding to your SSL
# certificate. The key is required to confirm the identity of the server and encrypt the
# data being transmitted.
#
# In the broadcasting configuration, these variables are used to configure the Guzzle
# HTTP client with appropriate SSL settings. By providing these files, you enable
# SSL/TLS encryption for broadcast services, enhancing the security of data in transit.

SSL_CERTIFICATE=""
SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY=""



# ===========================
# Vite Environment Configuration
# ===========================
#
# These Vite environment variables are used to configure the front-end build system
# and its integration with services such as Reverb for real-time functionality within
# the application.
#
# VITE_APP_NAME: Represents the application's name used within the Vite build process.
# It is typically a direct reflection of the application's name set in the Laravel backend.
#
# VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY: The Reverb application's key used for authentication. It should
# mirror the REVERB_APP_KEY variable set in the backend environment configuration.
#
# VITE_REVERB_APP_CLUSTER: The cluster designation for the Reverb setup, which specifies
# which region or data center the real-time data will be managed through.
#
# VITE_REVERB_HOST: Designates the host for the Reverb service. This is typically set
# from the corresponding backend environment variable REVERB_HOST.
#
# VITE_REVERB_PORT: Specifies the port that the Reverb service will run on, consistent
# with the setup from the backend environment variable REVERB_PORT.
#
# VITE_REVERB_SCHEME: Defines the protocol scheme used by the Reverb service, such as
# "http" or "https", typically mirroring the REVERB_SCHEME variable from the backend.

VITE_REVERB_SCHEME="${REVERB_SCHEME}"


# ===========================
# Queue Worker Configuration
# ===========================
#
# This configuration setting is used to specify the queue connection that should be used by the
# Laravel application. This is essential for managing asynchronous tasks such as sending emails,
# processing uploads, or any other task that can be handled in the background.
#
# QUEUE_CONNECTION: Defines the queue connection that the Laravel application will use.
# Options include "sync", "database", "redis", etc. The "database" connection is typically
# used to store jobs in a database table, which is useful for tracking, retrying, or monitoring
# queued jobs effectively.

QUEUE_CONNECTION=database


# ================================
# Authentication and Authorization
# ================================
#
# Access to HAWKI is restricted for registered users. In a production environment, you
# usually want to connect to your LDAP directory, OpenID provider, or Shibboleth service
# to make HAWKI available to your staff and/or students. For simpler setups (e.g., a small
# project setup for a single course), you can use the built-in Test User Authentication mechanism.
# This allows defining a small set of pre-allocated users in the local database (set up in advance by you).
#
# NOTE: If you want a small setup with fixed users but want to allow the users to change
# their passwords, you can install LLDAP (https://github.com/lldap/lldap) on the same
# machine than HAWKI.
#
# Supported authentication methods:
#   - LDAP
#   - OIDC (OpenID Connect)
#   - Shibboleth
#
# Set the AUTHENTICATION_METHOD variable to one of the following:
#
# AUTHENTICATION_METHOD="LDAP"
# AUTHENTICATION_METHOD="OIDC"
# AUTHENTICATION_METHOD="Shibboleth"
#
# According to your authentication method, set the necessary variables as follows:

# External Communication Configuration
# ====================================
#
# ALLOW_EXTERNAL_COMMUNICATION: This setting enables or disables the ability for users to generate and use API keys
# to access HAWKI models. When set to "true", users will be able to create API keys, allowing external applications
# to register and interact with HAWKI using the user's account. This is particularly useful for integrating
# HAWKI with third-party applications or for enabling programmatic access to HAWKI functionalities.
# Ensure that this feature is enabled only if you understand the security implications and have measures
# in place to protect API access and user data.
#
# Example: ALLOW_EXTERNAL_COMMUNICATION="true" or ALLOW_EXTERNAL_COMMUNICATION="false"

ALLOW_EXTERNAL_COMMUNICATION=false



# ==================
# Event Broadcasting
# ==================
#
# Lavarel contains an internal mechanism to broadcast events amongst servers.
