/**
 * # Router — Architecture Overview
 *
 * A `Router` is a reactive wrapper around a `universal-router` instance: it
 * resolves the current path into a page component + layout stack, tracks the
 * result as Svelte `$state`, and exposes it to `RouterView.svelte` — the only
 * consumer that renders a `Router`'s state. `RouterView` passes `data`,
 * `params` and `route` down to each page/layout as props; `RouterHandle`,
 * returned by `useRouter()`, is the navigation API components call
 * (`goTo`, `getPath`, `isActive`, ...) and holds no route state of its own.
 *
 * ## Construction
 *
 * {@link createRouter} (config callback) and {@link createRouterFromRegistrar}
 * (pre-built `RouteRegistrar`) both end up calling `registrar.build()` once
 * to get the `Route[]` tree, then wrap it in `UniversalRouter`. `RoutingExtension`
 * uses the latter to create `app.router` from the routes collected across all
 * plugins/modules.
 *
 * ## Path source: routing strategies
 *
 * A `Router` never reads `window.location` directly — it delegates to a
 * pluggable {@link RoutingStrategy} (`'path'` | `'hash'` | `'transient'`, see
 * `strategy/`), so the same resolution/state logic works whether the app
 * owns the browser URL, uses a hash fragment, or runs fully in-memory.
 * `Router.bind()` wires the strategy's changes into `runResolve()`.
 *
 * ## Resolution & state
 *
 * `runResolve()` is the single place that writes router state — `state`,
 * `component`, `layouts`, `meta`, `nodeData`, `error` are all set there,
 * so a page, a 404 and an error page all leave the router in one consistent
 * shape. Concurrent resolutions are guarded by a single `AbortController` (see
 * `RouterState.startRun()`): starting a resolution aborts its predecessor, so a
 * `runResolve()` call that finishes after a newer one has already started finds
 * its own signal aborted and discards itself rather than clobbering the faster,
 * later one.
 *
 * `universal-router`'s own 404 handling is repurposed: its `errorHandler`
 * always throws, wrapping in {@link RouteResolutionError} everything except a
 * `RouteRedirect`/`RouteHttpError` raised by a middleware, which pass through
 * untouched for `runResolve()` to act on. `runResolve()` then distinguishes a
 * 404 (`status === 404`) from a genuine failure to decide between
 * `state: 'notFound'` and `state: 'error'`.
 *
 * ## Layouts
 *
 * Every resolution rebuilds the layout stack from the matched route's parent
 * chain (see `nodes.ts`) plus the router-wide `rootLayout`, which also
 * covers the 404/error states since those have no matched route to inherit a
 * layout from.
 *
 * ## Data caching
 *
 * `nodeTree.ts`'s `runNode()` (called once per render-chain node) first
 * validates the node's params against its `paramSchema` (see
 * `parseNodeParams()`), then consults an LRU `dataCache` (see `dataCache.ts`)
 * keyed by each node's `cacheKey` (see `dataLoader.ts`) — computed from the
 * *parsed* params — before running its `loadData`, so a cache hit skips the
 * loader entirely. `RouterHandle.clearData()` invalidates entries; see its doc
 * comment for how it interacts with a resolution that is still in flight.
