/**
 * Materialises {@link RouteMiddleware}s as `universal-router` routes.
 *
 * `universal-router` has no dedicated middleware concept — instead it resolves
 * a matched route *before* descending into its children, and only stops when
 * an action returns something other than `null`/`undefined`. This module
 * exploits that: every middleware becomes an extra parent route with an empty
 * path (so it matches without consuming any part of the URL) whose `action`
 * calls the middleware with a wrapped `next`, and the guarded route becomes
 * its child. The wrapper translates HAWKI's PHP-style middleware contract
 * (return {@link RouteResultBody} | `next()` | nothing) into
 * `universal-router`'s `null`/`undefined` action semantics — see
 * {@link createMiddlewareRoute} for the case-by-case mapping.
 *
 * Used by {@link RouteRegistrar} when compiling both single routes
 * (`middlewares` from {@link RouteOptions}) and route groups (`middlewares`
 * from {@link RouteGroupOptions}).
 *
 * A middleware can also `import {redirect} from './signals.js'` and call it
 * to send the user elsewhere entirely, instead of returning a replacement
 * `RouteResultBody`. That distinction matters: swapping the component (the
 * only option before {@link import('./signals.js').RouteRedirect} existed)
 * changes what renders but leaves the URL pointing at a page the user was
 * never actually shown — a bookmark or reload lands back on the guarded
 * route and re-triggers the same swap. `redirect()` closes that gap by
 * updating the URL itself; see `router.ts`'s `runResolve()` for where
 * the signal is caught and turned into a new resolution.

/**
 * Wraps `children` in a path-less parent route that runs `middleware` first.
 *
 * Because `path: ''` matches anything without consuming URL segments, the
 * child paths stay unchanged. The action translates HAWKI's middleware
 * contract (return {@link RouteResultBody} | `next()` | nothing) into
 * `universal-router`'s action semantics:
 *
 * - `RouteResultBody` → returned as the resolve result; resolution stops.
 * - `undefined` from `next()` → also handed back, but `universal-router`
 *   treats `undefined` as "continue matching children", which for a wrapping
 *   middleware with a single guarded child means the child gets a chance.
 * - Any other nullish return (middleware returned nothing) → normalised to
 *   `null`, which makes `universal-router` skip the subtree entirely. With no
 *   siblings at this level, the guarded route 404s — the permission-deny path.
 *
 * The `next` handed to the middleware is wrapped so the `resume` footgun of
 * `universal-router`'s `context.next(true)` ("iterate all remaining routes",
 * which would escape the middleware chain and start matching siblings) is
 * unreachable from a HAWKI middleware.
