/**
 * # legacy.ts — the `window` seam between the old UI and the new Svelte app
 *
 * **Part of the transitional `legacy/` bridge.** Every export in this file is
 * `@deprecated` on purpose: it exists only for as long as HAWKI still ships the
 * old Blade + vanilla-JS UI (`public/js/*.js`, `resources/views/**`) alongside
 * the new Svelte 5 app, and is meant to be deleted, not extended.
 *
 * WHAT it does, in three parts:
 * 1. **Globals** — {@link provideLegacyGlobals} copies a hand-picked set of
 *    kernel functions, bridges and stores onto `window` so the legacy scripts
 *    can reach them (see the `declare global` block below for the full list).
 * 2. **Startup queues** — {@link runLegacyWaitUntilBootstrapQueue} and
 *    {@link runLegacyWaitUntilReadyQueue} drain the callbacks that inline
 *    scripts registered via `window.waitUntilBootstrap()` /
 *    `window.waitUntilReady()` before the bundle even loaded.
 * 3. **App accessor** — {@link setHawkiApp}/{@link getHawkiApp} hold the
 *    {@link HawkiApp} instance in a module-level singleton, so non-Svelte code
 *    (and other legacy modules) can reach the app without dependency injection.
 *
 * WHY it exists: the legacy scripts are plain `<script>` files with no module
 * system. `window` is the only namespace both sides can see, so this file is
 * the deliberately narrow, explicitly-typed doorway through it — instead of
 * globals being sprinkled ad-hoc across the codebase.
 *
 * NEW CODE MUST NOT USE ANY OF THIS. Import the real modules directly
 * (`$lib/kernel/...`), use `useApp()`/`useConfig()`/`useStore()` from
 * `$lib/app/hooks/*` inside components, and never read from `window`.
 *
 * @see EarlyFrontendBridge (`app/Services/Frontend/View/EarlyFrontendBridge.php`)
 *      — the Blade component that installs the `waitUntilReady`/`waitUntilBootstrap`
 *      stubs and their queue arrays before this bundle is parsed.
 * @see resources/js/app.ts — calls all three parts in the right order.
