    "AboutHAWKI_Info": "The offering was developed in the Interaction Design Lab at HAWK to give all university members the opportunity to integrate artificial intelligence into work processes and to have a space for exchange, potentially resulting in new working methods and fostering an internal university discussion on the use of AI. This offering also aims to provide didactic support, to develop an understanding of the functioning of a language model, and therefore gives indications of well-operating prompts (text inputs) in different areas. We welcome constructive feedback to further develop this offering in line with your needs and insights.",

This means that no one, not even the university, can see what you have written. 🕵️ Your entries are stored at OpenAI for 30 days and then deleted. GWDG does not store any data. In both cases, your data remains unused for product improvement or behavioral analysis.",

Once you have created the passkey, you can download it to your device. You should save this file in a safe place, for example on a USB stick or in a protected folder. If something goes wrong we can use this data to recover your chats.",
