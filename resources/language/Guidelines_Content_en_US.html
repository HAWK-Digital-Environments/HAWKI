<p>Welcome to the guide for handling HAWKI, which provides language models from OpenAI and open-source models via the GWDG.</p>

<p>This guide is intended to provide all university members with a clear guideline on how to responsibly handle this technology. Please note that this guide supplements the terms of use of OpenAI and does not claim to be exhaustive. It is the responsibility of the users to comply with the terms of use.</p>

<h3>General Provisions</h3>
<p><b>What is prohibited:</b></p>

<li>Input of personal data about yourself or others.</li>

<li>Use of the services for illegal, harmful, or abusive activities.</li>

<li>Violation, misuse, or infringement of the rights of others.</li>

<li>Modification, copying, renting, selling, or distribution of our services.</li>

<li>Attempting to reverse engineer, decompile, or discover the source code or underlying components.</li>

<li>Automated or program-controlled extraction of data or output.</li>

<li>Claiming that the output was created by humans when it was not.</li>

<li>Disruption or interference with the services or bypassing of security measures.</li>

<li>Use of output for developing competing models.</li>

<p><b>What to consider:</b></p>

<p>You are responsible for the input you provide and the resulting output. You must ensure that your input does not violate rights and that you have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to provide the input.</p>

<p><b>Accuracy:</b></p>

<p>Using the services may lead to inaccurate or faulty output. It is important that you critically examine the output and do not use it as the sole source of truth. Your inputs are not stored by HAWK but are retained by OpenAI for 30 days to detect potential misuse. After 30 days, the data is deleted. Your inputs are not used to make the product safer or better. HAWK has a data processing agreement with the GWDG, which states that no data sent to GWDG via HAWKI is stored by GWDG. An overview of the models provided by GWDG can be found at: <a href="https://docs.hpc.gwdg.de/services/chat-ai/models/index.html" target="_blank">https://docs.hpc.gwdg.de/services/chat-ai/models/index.html</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Group Chat:</b></h3>
<p>The following basic rules apply for respectful interaction in the group chat:</p>
<li>Treat other participants with respect and courtesy.</li>

<li>Constructive discussions are encouraged, but personal attacks or offensive language should be avoided.</li>

<li>Stay on topic and avoid spam or excessive self-promotion.</li>

<li>Do not spread false or misleading information.</li>

<li>Be aware that all messages in the group chat can be read and processed by group members.</li>

<li>The use of the group chat should adhere to the general ethical and data protection guidelines of the university.</li>

<li>In the case of abusive or discriminatory behavior, we reserve the right to exclude you from using HAWKI.</li>

<p>All content shared in the group chat can be seen and processed by other participants. Be aware that no sensitive or personal data should be shared in the chat.</p>

<h3>Specific Provisions</h3>
<p>There is a preliminary guideline and a declaration of independence for the use of generative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>For Students:</b></p>

<li>Use HAWKI to support your learning process, but do not rely exclusively on the generated responses.</li>

<li>Do not share personal data or information through HAWKI. This includes personal data of others.</li>

<li>You assume authorship. By doing so, you vouch for the quality of the response and take responsibility for the content. The use of AI and the nature of its contribution should be clearly stated.</p>

<p><b>For Educators:</b></p>

<li>HAWKI must not be used to correct student work if this work contains personal data that can be extracted.</li>

<li>Use HAWKI as a supplementary tool for preparing teaching materials, but ensure that all content is checked for accuracy and relevance.</li>

<p><b>For Staff:</b></p>

<li>It is strictly forbidden to enter confidentiality agreements or internally designated documents into HAWKI. This also applies to documents that contain personal data about yourself or others.</li>

<li>Use HAWKI to increase efficiency and support your daily tasks, while complying with the university's data protection policies and security regulations.</li>

<p>This guide serves as an orientation aid for the responsible use of HAWKI. It is important that all users understand and follow the mentioned provisions to ensure a safe and ethical use of this technology. The university can only offer this service if you do not enter personal data.</p>

<p>If you have questions or uncertainties, please contact Prof. Stefan WÃ¶lwer, Arian Sadafi, Jonas Trippler, or Vincent Timm. Regardless of this guide, OpenAI's terms of use apply.</p>
