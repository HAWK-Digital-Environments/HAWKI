### What's new in HAWKI 2?


- Group chats for peer-to-peer qualification 
University members can now exchange ideas in interactive chat rooms—similar to WhatsApp—and additionally integrate the generative AI at any time by addressing it as an additional participant in the group. This not only facilitates extended collaboration but also provides all participants the opportunity to use and understand the generative AI together.


- Export function with intelligent summarization 
The new automated documentation of prompts creates transparency in AI-supported work processes—an important step for use in examinations and scientific work.


- Modular architecture for rapid development 
HAWKI 2 is designed so that new features can be integrated even more quickly and flexibly. This allows educational institutions that use HAWKI to tailor the platform to their specific needs. We will be adding new features at short intervals!


- Various model options 
By allowing the use of different language models, HAWKI opens up to intercultural perspectives and more diverse use cases in university teaching. The differently trained language models are suitable for engaging with the values, norms, cultures, and biases within their respective models.


### Why HAWKI 2?

The updated HAWKI ecosystem deliberately emphasizes inter-university collaboration to design generative AI in a sustainable, transparent manner tailored to the needs of universities. Unlike commercial AI applications, HAWKI prioritizes the digital sovereignty of universities. The goal is to create a connected ecosystem that allows university members to interact with generative AI in their own way—without rigid guidelines, but with clear ethical and didactic principles.


**HAWKI 2 is open for everyone—join now, shape the future, and explore the possibilities of generative AI in university teaching!**
