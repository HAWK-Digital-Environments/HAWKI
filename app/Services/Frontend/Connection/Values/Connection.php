 * The `id` is either `"hawki"` for a native HAWKI session or the external app's user ID
 * for an external-app session. Optional fields are populated depending on `type`:
 * - `userinfo` — present when a user is authenticated (native or external-app)
 * - `extAppSecrets` — present only for `EXTERNAL_APP_AUTHENTICATED`; contains the
 *   per-user credentials the frontend needs to call the API on behalf of the ext-app user
 * - `extAppConnectRequest` — present only for `EXTERNAL_APP`; encrypted payload the
 *   frontend sends back to complete the account-linking flow
 * - `migrationsToApply` — present only for native authenticated sessions; tells the
 *   frontend how many frontend migrations are pending so it can run them on startup
 * - `keychainState` — present only for native authenticated sessions; tells the frontend
 *   whether the user's keychain can be unlocked, migrated, or has to be created
